-Error no.1 : opencv version 3.0 cause errors "cant find opencv_java300" that's why i use 2.4.9 ( 2.4.8 's ok as well )
-Error no.2 : 
	libpng warning: Image width is zero in IHDR
	libpng warning: Image height is zero in IHDR
	libpng error: Invalid IHDR data

	because the paths in the reference tutorial were not right . It had a redundant splash at the beginning (/D:/..)
	Fix : FaceDetector.class.getResource("lbpcascade_frontalface.xml").getPath().substring(1)
	
	Notice that this only worked in netbean . In eclipse i could not use this right I put the xml file in the root dir and use this line of code : CascadeClassifier faceDetector = new CascadeClassifier("./haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml"); Because the difference between the file structure of Netbean and Eclipse . In Eclipse if you get the url of the current class, your url will contain "bin/" while in netbean your classes are in src dir .
